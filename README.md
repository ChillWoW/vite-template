# A fully functional Vite template

## Disclaimer

-   This template has been made for the creation of FiveM scripts.

    -   By removing some utils and hooks, you will have a perfectly functioning normal vite template.

-   I am aware that this uses tailwind version 3.x and this is intentional.
    -   This has been done like this because I have the need to use it currently at only 3.x.
